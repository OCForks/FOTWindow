# FOTWindow

A ```NSWindow``` subclass that makes auto hiding and showing the title bar (Ã  la QuickTime X) a lot easier, and allows for a custom title bar drawing block.

## Usage

Just replace your ```NSWindow``` with a ```FOTWindow```. This can be done in your ```.xib``` file (see example project).
